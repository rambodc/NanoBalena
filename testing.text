1- open command line terminal from windows and open required path for development 
1- download the repo for gcp testing from https://github.com/balena-io-examples/google-iot using command:  "git clone https://github.com/balena-io-examples/google-iot"
2- open it in vs using command: "cd ."
by following the doc : https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/develop/integrations/google-iot/ i can't ran npm run gcp-setup (may be it support linux terminal), it run it from second option ./scripts/gcp-setup.sh 
3-After installing gcp-setup countered issue on pushing image to balena :
